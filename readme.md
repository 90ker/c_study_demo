# C++ Learning Journey

Start from 12.25.2024 and I will try to learn the basic of the c++ language.
And to beginning with, I will try to use it to implement some data structures like linked list and red-black tree.
Then for the algorithm, I will try to implement some basic algorithms like sort and search.
Finally, I will accomplish the basic network programming. like socket and tcp/ip. Even the ethernet protocol.
This is expected to take 1 month.
