# C++ Learning Journey

Starting from December 25th, 2024, I will begin learning C++ programming language fundamentals.

My learning path will include:

1. Data Structures
   - Linked List
   - Red-Black Tree

2. Algorithms
   - Sorting algorithms
   - Searching algorithms

3. Network Programming
   - Socket programming
   - TCP/IP protocols
   - Ethernet protocols

Expected duration: 1 month. Maybe I will get a month as time buffer.
